Authors: Neelima Agarwal, Sourav Pal, Aditya Srivastav, Anurag Tripathi

Version: 1.0 (November 2024)

Programming language: Wolfram Mathematica version 11.3 or higher 

A Mathematica implementation of the replica trick algorithm for calculating the mixing matrices for multiparton Cwebs. This repository contains the source code, manual and examples.

This package does not need an installation. 
The package file CWebGen.m can be put in the $UserBaseDirectory/Applications.
It can then be called in any mathematica session by running <<CwebGen`. 
One can check the available functions and their usage by using mathematica command "availablePublicFunctions[]".
